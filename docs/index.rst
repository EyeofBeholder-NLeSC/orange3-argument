Orange3 Argument Add-on Documentation
=====================================

This work is an open-source Python package that implements a pipeline of processing, classifying, and visualizing an argument corpus and the attacking relationship inside the corpus. 

It also implements the corresponding GUIs on a scientific workflow platform named `Orange3 <https://orangedatamining.com/>`_, so that users with little knowledge of Python programming can also benefit from it.
