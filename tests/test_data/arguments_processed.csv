Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable. Most importantly for me they have grips on the bottoms so my feet don't slide out from under me while doing planks, push-ups, etc. Highly satisfied with this purchase.;5;(-1, 0, 4, 0, 5);0.7125194610617208;0.8133346336041837

20;Great shoe. I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient.

57;"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo).

I ordered the shoes half a size up because as a former runner, I'm used to my feet needing room to spread and swell. I wish I hadn't because they feel a little roomy. I have orthotics, so I think I can remedy the issue once I swap those in.

These are light weight, hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability.

234;I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient. After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes.;4;(0, 0, 10, 25, -1, 21);0.5565706642449506;0.9107040750107305

I have many of the trail runner generations, and love them all. they're my go to sneakers for the gym use, or casual wear. I have a pair I used mostly for casual wear that have lasted about 5 years. Another pair that I used for cross fit/outdoor runs that lasted a little over a year (very vigorous daily use). All in all, these shoes are great for me.

315;"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.";5;(0, 2, 4, 1, 0, 12, -1, 20, 12, 9, 0, -1, 0, -1, 16, -1);0.6050042799664557;0.677020282518262

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.
