204;63;They are definitely a light - weight training shoe so I would n't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running .;0;0.11147629943899046;0.4
205;63;But this also makes them extremely comfortable , I had n't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these .;0;0.11147849651303832;0.325

213;64;"Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their "" Hurache's""/running shoes , so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own ( athletic , heel , boot ) .  ";0;0.14300924546018967;0.128125
